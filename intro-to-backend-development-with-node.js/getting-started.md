# Getting started

  
Here's what you need to do to get set up for the tutorial.

## Install Node.js

[Go to the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download it from there.  The most up-to-date version should be fine.

## Install a text editor

You will need somewhere to write your code.  There are a lot of popular, free text editors out there.  If you don't have one already, here are some suggestions.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Get the code from GitHub

The code you need for this tutorial lives in a **GitHub** **repository**.  

To get the code, you have two choices.  You can:

* Copy the code to your own GitHub account, then download it - or -
* [Just download it \(skip to the bottom of this page\)](getting-started.md#just-download-it)

### Copy the code to your own GitHub account

First of all, you will need to create a GitHub account.  After that, go to [https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop).

In the top right-hand corner of the page, you should see a button that says Fork.  Click that to copy the code into your own GitHub account.

Now that you have your own **fork** of the Node Girls repository, you can download it onto your computer.

Go to your computer's command-line program.  This will be either Terminal if you are using a Mac, or Powershell on Windows.  From there, find somewhere that you would like your code to be saved, maybe your desktop or documents folder.

If you're not confident with using the command line, ask a mentor and they will show you how!
{% endhint %}

Run the following command:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Command line" %}
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/express-workshop
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME with, well, your GitHub username  🙃

### Just download it

If you don't want a GitHub account, you can just download the files directly from the Node Girls repository.

Go to [https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop), and look for the green button that says Clone or Download.  Download the files as a `.zip`, then go and find them.
