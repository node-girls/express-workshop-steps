# Getting started

## Install Node.js

[Go to the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download it from there.  The most up-to-date version should be fine.

## Use the command line

In this tutorial you will be using the **command line** - a special program where you can type commands into your computer. It often looks like a plain window with a blinking cursor, rather like something out of the 80s.

### Using a Mac?

You will already have a command-line program called _Terminal_. You can access it by pressing `cmd+space` and searching for "Terminal".

### Using Windows?

The command-line program that comes with Windows is not the correct one for this tutorial. You will need to [install Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use that.

### I've never used the command line before...

That's ok! It's not as scary as it looks. We've got a [handy cheatsheet](../../command-line-cheatsheet.md) for you to use to learn some of the basic commands. Feel free to refer to it any time during the tutorial.

## Install a text editor

You will need somewhere to write your code.  There are a lot of popular, free text editors out there.  If you don't have one already, here are some suggestions.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Get the code from GitHub

The code you need for this tutorial lives in a **GitHub** **repository**. You will need to get a copy onto your computer. 

Go to [https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop), and look for the green button that says Clone or Download.  Download the files as a `.zip`. Then go and find the location of the `.zip` file and unzip it.
