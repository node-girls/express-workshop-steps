# Getting started

## Install Node.js

[Go to the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download it from there.  The most up-to-date version should be fine.

## Install a text editor

You will need somewhere to write your code.  There are a lot of popular, free text editors out there.  If you don't have one already, here are some suggestions.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Get the code from GitHub

The code you need for this tutorial lives in a **GitHub** **repository**. You will need to get a copy onto your computer. 

Go to [https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop), and look for the green button that says Clone or Download.  Download the files as a `.zip`. Then go and find the location of the `.zip` file and unzip it.
